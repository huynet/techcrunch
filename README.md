# TechCrunchAPI - *RSS Feed*

This is an unofficial [TechCrunch API](http://techcrunchapi.herokuapp.com/api) created from scratch.

## Overview

I have crawled TechCrunch's articles basic information, developed a simple API, and hosted it on Heroku with NodeJS and Express.

You can access the API [here](https://techcrunchapi.herokuapp.com/api)
